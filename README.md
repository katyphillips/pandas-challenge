# pandas-challenge
This is the repository for my Module 4 Challenge.  The final Python script for the project can be gound in the PyCitySchools folder.  The starter code and csv files are in the Resources folder.  I used Stack Overflow to help write the groupby function that I used in the cell instructing us to find the average math and reading scores per school.
